## 🚀 Ready for Deployment

### Pre-Deployment Tasks
1. [ ] Fork repository to your GitHub
2. [ ] Set up Supabase project and get credentials
3. [ ] Test Docker build locally
4. [ ] Prepare environment variables

### Deployment Tasks
1. [ ] Connect repository to Railway
2. [ ] Configure environment variables
3. [ ] Trigger first deployment
4. [ ] Verify health endpoint
5. [ ] Test API endpoints

### Post-Deployment Tasks
1. [ ] Monitor logs for errors
2. [ ] Test all major endpoints
3. [ ] Verify Swagger UI works
4. [ ] Set up monitoring/alerts
5. [ ] Document your deployment URL

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **First deployment**: Takes 10-15 minutes due to model downloads
- **Memory**: Ensure adequate RAM for AI models (2GB+ recommended)
- **Environment**: Never commit `.env` files to repository
- **Security**: Use strong random `SECRET_KEY` in production
- **Monitoring**: Set up Railway alerts for downtime

## 🎯 Success Criteria

Your deployment is successful when:
- ✅ Health endpoint returns 200 OK
- ✅ Swagger UI loads at `/swagger/`
- ✅ Color analysis endpoint works
- ✅ Similar products API responds
- ✅ No critical errors in logs
